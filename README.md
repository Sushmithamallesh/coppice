Questions I keep asking myself:
1. Will user be allowed to add questions and topics? Yes. Because you want them to be able to select or write a topic in like a simple word. But questions they can go as deep as they want to. They can make it to more nuanced.

2. Should there be a time preference?
Yes I think so. Its just easy to do it. 1 and 7 days for now.
